# flutter_high_low_graph
A json file is created using a python script. It consists of keys as name of the days of week. Every key has 3600 random values.
The random values actually represnt heartrate. It is to demonstrate if a smart device is monitoring a person's heartbeat throughout
a workout session or a day on a certain day of a week of certain date, then s/he needs to know the maximum and minimum heartbeat
that was measured. Maximum representing if the person was working out and minimum representing if person was calm, or sleeping.
This is also to test when we work with databases like MongoDB, firebase etc when we have to work with json and map datas.
